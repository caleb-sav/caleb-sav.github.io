Data Task
===============
The data task calculates the positions for the motors to make the drawing. When 
first run, the data task reads in an .hpgl file selected by the value of the 
shared variable ``image`` (set in the :ref:`Interface Task`), then sets the 
``calculated`` variable to False, triggering the next section. This section parses 
the .hpgl file and uses the Newton-Raphson function (described below) to calculate 
the necessary motion of the motors.
