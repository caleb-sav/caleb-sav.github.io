Motor Task
================
The motor task takes angle values out of a queue and drives the motors to those positions. 
A finite state diagram of the system is shown below.

**State 0: INIT** - Creates the pin, timer, SPI, motor, and servo objects. Motors are calibrated 
and the servo is set to the 'down' position.

**State 1: WAIT** - Disables the motors by default, until the shared variable ``run`` is set to 
True. Then the motors are enabled and the code moves on to the next state.

**State 2: NEW_TARG** - Pulls the next target angles from the queue and assigns one to each motor. 
The pen position for that point is sent to the servo. Immediately continues to State 3.

**State 3: TRAVEL** - Waits until both motors are within a certain threshold from their target 
values, then returns to State 1 to start the process over.
