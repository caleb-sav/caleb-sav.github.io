Type Task
===============
Type task is nearly identical to the data task, except that the input is not an 
image selection, but a word via the ``send_word`` shared variable. Each letter of 
the word is loaded, parsed, and drawn one at a time to minimize memory usage. The 
input word is also scaled to fit the usable area to prevent the machine drawing 
off the paper.

More more details on the parsing and processing, see the :ref:`Data Task`.
