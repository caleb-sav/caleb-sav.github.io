Code
=====
All the code for this project was written in microPython, a version of Python that 
has been optimized to run on the limited resources of microcontrollers. The main 
structure is a cooperative multitasking system with tasks for interfacing with the 
user, calculating the required motion, and driving the motors. A task diagram showing 
the interaction of these tasks can be found below.
