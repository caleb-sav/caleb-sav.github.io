   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Overview
===============================================================

The goal of the project was to create a robot which could draw images in any 
way. To increase the challenge, we were not allowed to use cartesian coordinates. 
Polar coordinates were a popular choice, but many other configurations emerged 
from our classmates. Our design consists of two variable radii, intersecting at 
the end.

As shown below, the drawing ability of the robot is fairly accurate.

An interesting feature of this robot is the ability to write words typed by the 
user. More detail can be found in the :ref:`Type Task`.
