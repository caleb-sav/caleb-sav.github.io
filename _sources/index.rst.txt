   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Intro
===============================================================

The goal of the project was to create a robot which could draw images in any 
way. To increase the challenge, we were not allowed to use cartesian coordinates. 
Polar coordinates were a popular choice, but many other configurations emerged 
from our classmates. Our design consists of two variable radii, intersecting at 
the end.
